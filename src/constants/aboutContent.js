We are Paper Crane Lab - an education space in Bangalore, India. We run classes and session
in the area of Science and Technology (STEM subjects) by combining it with creative projects.
<br>
We work with an enthusiastic team of educators who work in the intersection of science,
technology and art.
<br>
<br>
Our classes allow for students to learn how we can practically and creatively
use the tools at our disposal. We encourage out of the box solutions, and creative
problem solving, all while learning skills like electronics, coding and mechanisms.
